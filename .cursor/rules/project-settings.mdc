# Project Settings Rules

## Package Management
- Prefer native git hooks over the husky usage
- Disable `package-lock.json` for projects, because it conflicts with modern dependency sharing approach based on `importmaps`, HTTPS imports and CDN code parts delivery for common packages

## Code Quality Tools
- Do not use `eslint`
- Do not use `prettier`

## Testing
- Do not use `jest` for testing
- Prefer to use native built-in Node.js testing packages
